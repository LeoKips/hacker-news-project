# Hacker News Project
Hacker News is a platform where posts receive votes and comments and is popular in technology and startup circles. Posts that make it into the top of the Hacker News can garner up to a hundred thousand visitors as a result.

In the Hacker News dataset, our interest is in titles that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. We willtherefore compare the two types of posts and determine which type received more comments on average. We will also check if posts created at a certain time received more comments on average.
